# Ludovico

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ludovico.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ludovico) ![CI workflow](https://github.com/aitorres/ludovico/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

An opinionated DataFrame-to-TeX table generator.

## What's this?

Ludovico is a small tool to generate valid TeX tables from data contained within Pandas DataFrames. It's a personal tool that I'm developing to assist myself in the process of generating tables for my Computer Science undergraduate senior thesis, which requires making a considerable amount of tables from data that is currently handled as dataframes.

Note that this codebase is wildly unstable, messy and caffeine-ridden. Contributions welcome!
